1. Create a Graph data structure.
2. Distinguish between 'state' nodes, and 'dependency' nodes.
3. The Graph should be constructed from a list of links.
4. Create an get_execution_procedure function, that lists all the dependency nodes (including nested)Â connected to a state node,
    and then moves on to the next state, and does the same, recursivley.
