1. Can a State Node have multiple State Nodes as children?
2. Could a Dependecy Node have a State Node as its child?
3. For each State Node, does the order of execution of the Dependencies matter?
4. Can we have duplicate Dependencies per State execution? Or should I put every dependency in only once?
5. Design thought: is having a type attribute on the Node class enough? Or should I implement a class for each type with inheritance?
